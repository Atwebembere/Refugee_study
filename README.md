Coping Strategies and Resilience Among Displaced Youth in Bidibidi Settlement

****Data provided upon reasonable request***

üß© Problem Statement / Background

Displaced youth in refugee settlements face immense psychological stressors. This study investigates how different coping mechanisms‚Äîproblem-focused, emotion-focused, social support, and spiritual practices‚Äîpredict resilience among adolescents and young adults in Bidibidi, Uganda. The goal is to identify actionable psychosocial levers for improving mental health in protracted displacement contexts.

üõ†Ô∏è Methods Used
	‚Ä¢	Tool: R (v4.4.1)
	‚Ä¢	Packages: MASS, brant, car, ordinal, ggplot2, sjPlot, among others
	‚Ä¢	Statistical Models:
	‚Ä¢	Proportional-odds ordinal logistic regression
	‚Ä¢	Brant test for proportionality assumption
	‚Ä¢	QR decomposition for rank diagnostics
	‚Ä¢	Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for multicollinearity
	‚Ä¢	Data Management:
	‚Ä¢	Row-wise total scoring of five validated scales
	‚Ä¢	Categorical recoding for demographics
	‚Ä¢	Sample restricted to 108 participants with complete cases

üìà Key Findings
	‚Ä¢	Strongest predictors of resilience:
	‚Ä¢	Social Support Coping (OR = 1.44; p < 0.001)
	‚Ä¢	Spiritual Practices (OR = 1.15; p = 0.005)
	‚Ä¢	Non-significant predictors:
	‚Ä¢	Emotion-Focused Coping
	‚Ä¢	Problem-Focused Coping (positive trend)
	‚Ä¢	Vulnerability flag:
	‚Ä¢	Youth aged 25+ had significantly lower resilience (OR = 0.15; p = 0.003)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Code (R)
	1.	Software Requirement:
	‚Ä¢	R version 4.4.1 or higher
	‚Ä¢	RStudio (recommended for IDE)
	2.	Install Required Packages (once): install.packages(c("MASS", "car", "brant", "ordinal", "ggplot2", "sjPlot"))

 	3.	Open & Run
	‚Ä¢	Open PCMR.Rmd in RStudio
	‚Ä¢	Click ‚ÄúKnit‚Äù to produce a full HTML report, or run chunks manually
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the dataset (likely named df2 or similar) is loaded correctly
	4.	Expected Outputs:
	‚Ä¢	Regression tables for ordinal logistic model
	‚Ä¢	Diagnostic results (Brant test, VIF)
	‚Ä¢	Descriptive summaries of all scales
	‚Ä¢	Forest and calibration plots for model interpretability
	5.	Data Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Data was cleaned and preprocessed in R
	‚Ä¢	All participants had complete scores on 5 coping/resilience scales
	‚Ä¢	Demographics recoded for analytic clarity (e.g., Age: 18‚Äì24 vs. 25+)
