Coping Strategies and Resilience Among Displaced Youth in Bidibidi Settlement

üß© Problem Statement / Background

Displaced youth in refugee settlements face immense psychological stressors. This study investigates how different coping mechanisms‚Äîproblem-focused, emotion-focused, social support, and spiritual practices‚Äîpredict resilience among adolescents and young adults in Bidibidi, Uganda. The goal is to identify actionable psychosocial levers for improving mental health in protracted displacement contexts.
